# Hello Godot Asset Library

> Letâ€™s dive into building an asset for the Godot Library and check out some great tools from the community along the way.


Catch my eyes:
- FSM https://codeberg.org/HexagonNico/FiniteStateMachine
  - Finite State Machine code without the UI but quickly and easily usable 
- Input Icons https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2611
  - Very nice SVG input for keyboard, xbox and PS with some code aroudn it. 
- Input Overlayer for tutorial https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2204
  - If you want to learn how to make your own overlayer in Godot.
